= Antq on projects that use an old version of Clojure 

Antq does not support Clojure 1.10.0 or earlier.
You can still use antq on these older projects; follow the steps below. 

== Clojure CLI

Use `:deps`, not `:extra-deps`.
This will use the default Clojure cli version, instead of the older Clojure version on which your project depends.

TIP: This assumes your installed Clojure cli version is 1.10 or later.

[source,clojure]
----
{:aliases {:outdated {:deps {com.github.liquidz/antq {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}
                      :main-opts ["-m" "antq.core"]}}}
----


If you must use `:extra-deps`, add an antq supported version of Clojure explicitly in an alias that uses antq as follows.

[source,clojure]
----
{:aliases {:outdated {:extra-deps {;; Use 1.8.0 or later only for antq
                                   org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.11.1"}
                                   com.github.liquidz/antq {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}
                      :main-opts ["-m" "antq.core"]}}}
----

Then, run `clojure -M:outdated`.

== Leiningen

Please run antq as a plugin.
Running as plugin will ignore the Clojure version which your project depends.

[source,clojure]
----
 :plugins [[com.github.liquidz/antq "RELEASE"]]
 ;; optional - you can add antq options here:
 :antq {}
----

Then, run `lein antq`.
